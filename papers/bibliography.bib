  abstract = {—In power systems with high shares of variable and limitedly predictable renewables, power system operators need to schedule flexible load, generation and storage to maintain the power system balance when forecast errors occur. To ensure a reliable and cost-effective power system operation, novel reserve sizing and allocation methods are needed. Although stochastic formulations of the unit commitment problem allow calculating an optimal trade-off between the cost of scheduling and activating reserves, load shedding and curtailment, these models may become computationally intractable for real-life power systems. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a novel set of probabilistic reserve constraints, which allows internalizing the reserve sizing and allocation problem in a deterministic unit commitment model, considering the full cost of reserve allocation and activation. Extensive numerical simulations show that this novel formulation yields UC schedules that are nearly as cost-effective as the theoretical optimal solution of the stochastic model in calculation times similar to that of a deterministic equivalent.

  abstract  = {An electricity generation system adequacy assessment aims to generate statistically significant adequacy indicators given projected developments in, i.a., renewable and conventional generation, demand, demand response and energy storage availability. Deterministic unit commitment (DUC) models with exogenous reserve requirements, as often used in today's adequacy studies to represent day-to-day power system operations, do not account for the contribution of operating reserves to the adequacy of the system. Hence, the adequacy metrics obtained from such an analysis represent a worst-case estimate and should be interpreted with care. In this paper, we propose to use a DUC model with a set of state-of-the-art probabilistic reserve constraints (DUC-PR). The performance of the DUC-PR model in the context of adequacy assessments is studied in a numerical case study. The Expected Energy Not Served (EENS) volume obtained with the DUC model is shown to be a poor estimate of the true EENS volume. In contrast, the DUC-PR methodology yields an accurate estimate of the EENS volume without significantly increasing the computational burden. Policy makers should encourage adopting novel operational power system models, such as the DUC-PR model, to accurately estimate the contribution of operating reserves to system adequacy.},

  abstract  = {The possibly increasing volatile gas off-take from gas-fired power plants to accommodate volatile renewable generation in combination with the integration of power-to-gas (P2G) warrants further study into the operation of a coupled electrical power and natural gas system. Therefore, this paper presents and validates a novel operational model comprising both the electrical power and gas systems. Model improvements include (i) the use of zonal gas loads in addition to nodal loads, (ii) ramp rates for conventional gas production facilities and, (iii) an improved detailed technological model of P2G units, which all increase the realism of the obtained results. Results of several small-scale case studies illustrate the relevance of these model additions. In addition, a case study inspired by the Belgian electrical power and gas systems shows that the Belgian gas network has abundant capacity to integrate a possibly volatile injection of synthetic methane from P2G. This model may be used by electricity and gas transmission system operators to study the interaction between their systems and inform policy makers and regulators.},

  abstract = {The massive integration of variable and limitedly predictable electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES) leads to so-called balancing costs (a.o. integration costs). Therefore, system operators are continuously seeking novel sources of operational flexibility and improved methods to size, procure and deploy the associated operational reserves. With these challenges in mind, we develop an operational modeling framework to study the impact of stochastic RES-based generation, novel flexibility providers and demand response on day-to-day electricity generation system operation. This framework consists of a statistical characterization of the uncertainty, which provides input for the generation of scenarios and reserve sizing techniques, which in turn are representations of the uncertainty in so-called unit commitment (UC) models. Historically, these models were typically deterministic in nature, which may make them poorly suited to study and operate power systems with high shares of limitedly predictable RES-based generation. Therefore, the first objective set forth in this dissertation relates to the improvement of existing and the development of novel UC models considering imperfect RES-based electricity generation forecasts, with a focus on the cost-efficiency, reliability and computational effort associated with their solutions. We study and improve the performance of three UC models found in the scientific literature: a deterministic UC model, a stochastic UC model and an improved interval UC model.In pursuit of a UC model that combines the cost-optimality of the stochastic model with the computational effort of the deterministic model, we develop two novel UC formulations: a hybrid deterministic-stochastic and a probabilistic UC model. The second objective addressed in this dissertation relates to the study of the arbitrage and regulation services an activated demand side may offer. In particular, we study the system value of demand response with electric heating systems. To this end, an integrated model is proposed, which entails the inclusion of a physical demand side model, sufficient to represent the operational flexibility available in limitedly controllable residential electric heating systems, in a probabilistic UC model. In a numerical case study, inspired by the Belgian power system, demand response-based arbitrage and regulation services are shown to contribute significantly to the minimization of the balancing cost associated with imperfect RES-based generation forecasts. The presented models and techniques can be used to assess the impact of uncertainty on reasonably large electric power systems, as illustrated in the last chapter of this dissertation. Independent system operators may use these models to optimize their UC decisions taking into account the uncertainty in their system. The integrated model may lead to adequate estimates of the system value of DR. In addition, demand aggregators may use the presented approach to optimize the scheduling and operation of DR-adherent loads.},
